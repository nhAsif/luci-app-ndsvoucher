# Implementation Overview

## Project Goals

The goal of this project was to replace the original RoseNet Access Portal's Go-based backend with a pure shell script implementation integrated into LuCI, while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Key Changes from Original Implementation

### 1. Elimination of Go Server
- **Original**: Go-based HTTP server running on port 7891
- **New**: Pure shell script backend with LuCI integration

### 2. Database Changes
- **Original**: SQLite database with CGO-free Go driver
- **New**: JSON files for data storage

### 3. Administration Interface
- **Original**: Custom HTML/JavaScript admin panel
- **New**: LuCI-integrated administration interface

### 4. User Interface
- **Original**: Custom HTML/JavaScript voucher entry page
- **New**: LuCI-served voucher entry page

### 5. Service Management
- **Original**: Custom init.d script for Go server
- **New**: Standard OpenWrt package with UCI defaults

## Implementation Details

### Shell Script Backend

The core functionality has been reimplemented in shell scripts located at `/usr/share/ndsvoucher/scripts/`:

1. **voucher.sh**: Main backend script providing functions for:
   - Voucher management (add, delete, list)
   - Voucher validation
   - Client authentication
   - Admin authentication
   - Configuration management

2. **binauth.sh**: NoDogSplash authentication script that:
   - Receives authentication requests from NoDogSplash
   - Validates clients against the JSON database
   - Returns session duration for authorized clients

3. **configure-nodogsplash.sh**: Script to configure NoDogSplash integration

### LuCI Integration

The LuCI application provides:

1. **Controller** (`luasrc/controller/ndsvoucher.lua`):
   - Routes HTTP requests to appropriate handlers
   - Provides API endpoints for AJAX operations
   - Serves both admin and public web pages

2. **Configuration Interface** (`luasrc/model/cbi/ndsvoucher/`):
   - Settings page for configuration
   - Voucher management page

3. **Views** (`luasrc/view/ndsvoucher/`):
   - Templates for web interfaces

### Data Storage

All data is stored in simple JSON files:

1. **voucher.json**: Contains all voucher information
2. **settings.json**: Contains configuration settings

This approach eliminates the need for a database server while maintaining data persistence across reboots.

### NoDogSplash Integration

The integration with NoDogSplash is maintained through:

1. **Custom binauth script**: Handles authentication requests
2. **Splash page**: Redirects users to the voucher entry page
3. **Configuration**: Automatically configured during installation

## Advantages of This Implementation

### 1. Simplicity
- No compiled binaries to manage
- All code is human-readable shell scripts
- Easy to modify and extend

### 2. Integration
- Seamless integration with LuCI
- Standard OpenWrt package management
- Unified configuration through UCI

### 3. Resource Usage
- Lower memory footprint
- No persistent server process
- Minimal CPU usage

### 4. Maintainability
- Easier to debug issues
- No dependency on specific Go versions
- Standard OpenWrt development practices

## Compatibility

This implementation maintains full compatibility with:
- Existing NoDogSplash configurations
- Voucher code formats
- API endpoints (where applicable)
- User workflow

## Testing

The implementation has been designed with testability in mind:
- Simple test script included
- Clear separation of concerns
- Well-defined interfaces between components

## Deployment

Deployment is simplified compared to the original:
- Single package installation
- Automatic configuration
- Standard OpenWrt service management

## Future Considerations

While this implementation meets all the requirements, there are some considerations for future enhancements:

1. **Performance**: For very large numbers of vouchers, JSON parsing might become a bottleneck
2. **Security**: Shell scripts require careful input validation
3. **Extensibility**: The modular design makes it easy to add new features
